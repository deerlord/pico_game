#STATUS
Current
- collision with map works
- a little janky on some diagonals

#WIP
- adjust air and ground friction
- set (and use) state?

#IDEAS

collision diagonals
- seems like ray is not fully traced before end of frame
- add 1 to max iteration?
- start at -1 instead of 0?

###collision reduction

if collide
- if tiles on either side, xspd needs to be 0; else xspd is reduced by yspd
- `local xchange = (left or right) and 0 or a.xspd / abs(a.yspd) + 1`
- `10 / 1 + 1; 10 / 2 = 5`
- `10 / 10 + 1; 10 / 11 = .9`
- very odd bugs with this, always going right? -0?
